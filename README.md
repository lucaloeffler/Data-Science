Hey,
thanks for checking out my Data Sience Repo!
Here I am collectting all my work 

## AI Programming with Python

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application. The command line application consists of two parts. In the first part is an application to train the AI and the second part is used to predict an image based on the trained network.

You can have a look at the curriculum here[Link].
